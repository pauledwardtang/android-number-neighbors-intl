# Number Neighbors International

## Description
This is a simple demo app showcasing the [numverify API](https://numverify.com/documentation) to find number neighbors across different countries. It selects 5 countries at random and verifies a given phone number against the numverify API and displays the results. No more no less.

## Usage
Use mockDebug/mockRelease to test with mock data instead of consuming API quota.

For the prod variant, add your API key in build.gradle (or better yet, from your environment or elsewhere).
